# Instructions for all Commands

The implementation shall be documented in file AdvancedFileServer_Implementation.md
while we are making progress. It shall not have the same information as the git
commit messages but modified in a way to result in a compact description of the
found solution.

Do not implement more than you are asked for. The user stories should lead the
development, step by step using one story at a time.
