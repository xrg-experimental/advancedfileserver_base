DSM Package Structure

I want to create installable packages for Synology NAS devices. I am using the development toolkit from Synology
as described in the Developer Guide for version 7 of the DMS with chroot commands and scripts from
https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/pkgscripts-ng, branch DSM7.2. The main script I use is PkgCreate.py.


Create the files needed for PkgCreate.py to create a DSM package with the name AdvancedFileServer_Server.
Here are some data points.
version: 0.1.1-001
os_min_ver: 7.2-64555
description: "The AdvancedFileServer is a Synology package designed to provide secure file sharing capabilities with
              a focus on client separation and granular access control. It integrates with DSM's existing storage and
              security infrastructure while providing additional features for external sharing and user management."
arch: "x86_64 armv8"

Create just the minimal needed files and add no extra code. I cannot progress without testing package install on a
test DSM.

/read-only AdvancedFileServer/conf/privilege

for afs-srv:

/add afs-srv/pom.xml
/add afs-srv/src
/add afs-srv/.gitignore

--------------------------------------
for all steps:

/read-only docs/AdvancedFileServer_Architecture_Design.md
/read-only docs/AdvancedFileServer_User_Stories.md
/read-only docs/aider-reference.md

Start a command with:

Given the aider-reference, help me implement the database initialization script following our standard paths and SQLite configuration.

Given the aider-reference, help me implement the basic SQLite configuration in Spring Boot with:
- Database file location in package persistent storage
- Basic user and group entity schemas

Given the aider-reference, help me implement tests for the basic user and group functions.

Given the aider-reference, help me implement the switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL as in docs/AdvancedFileServer_PostgreSQL.md described.
