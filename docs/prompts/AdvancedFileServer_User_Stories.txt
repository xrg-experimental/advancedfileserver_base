Assume you are a Product Manager and responsible for the development of the AdvancedFileServer.
We have software developers with detailed knowledge in different disciplines. You are asked to
take the attached document and generate a long list of user stories to make all parts of the
app vivid. You can consider an existing list of user stories which may be outdated and incomplete.
The developers should decide step by step which user story they should implement next.
You should generate additional stories for the developers to make the implementation steps smaller,
e.g. creating and installing a dummy package on the NAS can be a valuable step forward. Please
create a numbered list. The developers should reference the user stories number by number to
document the steps they are working on.
