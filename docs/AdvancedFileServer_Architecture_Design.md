# AdvancedFileServer Architecture Design
## System Overview

The AdvancedFileServer is a Synology package designed to provide secure file sharing 
capabilities with a focus on granular access control. It integrates with DSM's existing 
storage and security infrastructure while providing additional features for external 
sharing and user management.

## Core Components

### 1. Backend Architecture
- **Spring Boot Application**
  - Runs as a non-root service within Synology package constraints
  - Integrates with DSM's security model for administration accounts
  - RESTful API design for all operations
  - Embedded database for user/share management
  - Integration with DSM file system

### 2. Frontend Architecture
- **Angular Single Page Application**
  - Access through the DSM
  - Responsive design for mobile access
  - Role-based UI components
  - File explorer interface

### 3. Security Layer
- **Authentication Services**
  - DSM authentication for administrator accounts
  - Custom authentication for other users
  - JWT-based token management
  - Password encryption for shared links

### 4. Storage Management
- **Virtual File System**
  - Mapped to DSM storage
  - Each group has its own folder
  - Access control lists (ACL)
  - Temporary storage for shared link structures

## User Roles & Permissions

### 1. External Users (Anonymous)
- Access through secure links only
- Time-limited access
- Optional upload permissions
- No login required
- Restricted to shared content only

### 2. Registered Users
#### Internal Users
- Full access to assigned groups
- Link creation capabilities
- File and folder management
- User profile management

#### External Users
- Limited access to assigned groups
- No link creation rights
- Basic file operations
- User profile management

### 3. Administrators
- User management
- Group administration
- System configuration
- Link management
- Monitoring and reporting

## Technical Integration

### 1. Synology Package Integration
- **Package Components**
  - Java Runtime Environment (bundled)
  - Spring Boot application
  - Angular frontend
  - Configuration files
  - PostgreSQL database

- **System Integration**
  - DSM security framework
  - File system permissions
  - Network services
  - Email services

### 2. Database Schema
- User management
- Group management
- Share management
- Configuration storage
- Access logs

## Core Features

### 1. File Sharing
- Secure link generation
- Expiration dates
- Password protection
- Upload capabilities
- Activity logging

### 2. User Management
- Self-registration
- Admin approval workflow
- Group assignment
- Role management
- Access control

### 3. File Management
- Hierarchical structure
- Group-based separation
- Version control
- Audit logging
- Search capabilities

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption
- At-rest encryption
- Secure file transfer
- Password policies

### 2. Access Control
- Role-based access
- IP restrictions
- Session management
- Audit logging

## System Requirements

### 1. Hardware
- DSM 7.2 or higher
- x86_64 or ARM64 architecture
- Minimum 1GB RAM for package
- Sufficient storage space

### 2. Software
- Java Runtime (bundled)
- DSM File Services
- DSM Security Services
- SMTP server (configurable)

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Package Distribution
- Self-contained package
- Automated installation
- Configuration wizard
- Update mechanism

### 2. Data Migration
- Database initialization
- Configuration import/export
- Backup integration

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 1. System Health
- Activity monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Storage usage
- User sessions

### 2. Maintenance
- Log rotation
- Database maintenance
- Temporary file cleanup
- System backups

## Future Considerations

### 1. Integration
- Third-party authentication
- API extensions
- Additional security features

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Code Organization
- Modular architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Standard naming conventions
- Documentation requirements

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Security testing
- Performance testing

## Initial Development Focus
1. Core authentication and authorization
2. Basic file sharing functionality
3. User management system
4. Essential administrative features
5. Basic monitoring and logging

This design provides a foundation for detailed specifications while considering Synology's package development constraints and security requirements.
